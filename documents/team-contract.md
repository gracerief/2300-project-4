# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.
  - **Silver Mammoth**
    - Grace Rieflin -- gkr9
    - Bolatito Adetula -- ba353
    - Marissa Holl -- mlh297
    - Jannie Li -- jl2578
    - Audrey Fan -- af496


2. To what goals do we all commit?
To create a website that successfully fulfills and satisfies our client's needs (the Ukulele Club), and to do this as a team.


3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
Respond to communication by teammates and clients in a timely and courteous manner.
Put in a necessary amount of effort and not leave any member behind.


4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
Communicate constantly, as needed.
Meet as a full group around once a weak, and in smaller groups to meet deadlines more frequently, as needed. Communication will be made via our group chat on SMS.


5. How will we communicate and work with our client?
Depending on what the client wants, but maintain constant email contact, as well as in-person meeting as necessary to ensure accurate communication of all aspects of the project.


6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
- `Client Point-of-Contact`: the person that is solely responsible for conveying the team's needs to and from the client. If we need to get content, users, or anything from the client to move forward with the project, this person will *immediately* reach out to the client with detailed communication instructions, including the urgency of the request.
- `Scheduler`: Manages accommodating time conflicts/constraints for all team members, and sets meeting times that are *amply* in-advance of any submission deadlines. Also will propose deadlines for each task/milestone upon completion of the previous milestone.
- `Delegator`: lays out all the TO-DOs for each milestone at the very start of work for that milestone; allows team members to suggest which tasks they would like to be personally responsible for, and assigns remaining tasks to those who do not vocalize preference; also checks to ensure that each team member is contributing a fair amount to the project, and vocalizes discrepancies in workloads when necessary.
 - `Styler`: this team member will be mostly in charge of making sure that the styling follows the styling guidelines of the class. She will also be in charge of maintaining the all.css file in the future and monitoring any changes to the file.
- `*The Closer*`: the last person to touch the project repository before committing and pushing; checks in the team groupchat to ensure that everyone's work has been completed before pushing; *is in-charge of changing submit-##.md to grademe-##.md.*




7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
 - We will try our best to be very explicit with each person's tasks, deadlines, and expectations for each milestone and miscellaneous task.
 - We will be keeping open and friendly communication with teammates, so that we hold each other accountable.
 - For members who do not seem to be contributing as much as others, we will directly contact them to inquire about their schedule and conflicts. In the unlikely event that it does not work out, we will reach out to a TA for help.



8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict do we all agree to uphold?
  - We want each team member to vocalize their ideas and perspectives, and the group must listen to those ideas, then we will discuss other members' thoughts on the ideas, and take a vote if necessary.
  - If our disagreement is about a requirement, we can approach the TA on their opinion.


9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
  - If we find that some hurdle comes about that we are unsure how to handle, we will revisit this contract and add clauses where necessary--notifying all team members of the changes.
  - once we become more familiar with our team's work dynamics, we should be thinking about what we agreed-upon here and revisit it to make sure that everything still applies to the way that we work in-practice, so that we to not run into any (above) hurdles.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
 - Food makes people happy. We want to stay happy.
 - Fun fact: 3/5 of us have July birthdays! And the other 2 have February birthdays!! Simply wow.
 - Again. Food is great.



## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
